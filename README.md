Steps to open project:
1. Open the "Project_Template" folder
2. Open the file "Project_Template.sln"

For the Standalone .exe file:
1. Open the "Project_Template" folder
2. Run the file "Project_Template.exe"

How to interact with the project: 
On startup, you will be asked whether to add or remove certain shading effects through the terminal. 
After a short while the program will pause and yet again ask through the terminal what shading effects to include. 

What the project includes
The project started as a simple rendering of a multicoloured triangle, and now the project includes 
implementations of point sprites, cel shading, noise generation and a skybox.

The project was written on a Windows 10 PC on Visual Studio 2019.

For a closer look as to how the program works, here is a video detailing how the program and its different 
shaders and techniques fit together: https://youtu.be/SZx--hta90M

For what I would have done differently if I had time to re-do the project, I would have liked to implement 
Realtime interaction with the project, being able to move the camera around and toggle the graphical effects 
without having to pause the program.
